				<p>My name's <b>mona</b>. I'm a teenager and image macro enthusiast from the internet. My pronouns are she/her and my favorite color is orangered. Nice to meet you.<br>This website was founded in 2017 as a Serial Experiments Lain fanpage and was reset in 2020 as a personal webpage. The content here will primarily revolve around my technical projects.</p>
				<p>Tiny, self-written, .GIF-filled websites have been part of my life for a long time. One of the first websites I actively explored as a kid was <a href="http://www.mimitchi.com">mimitchi.com</a>, a website that, incidentally, would coincide directly with some of my longest-standing interests, including virtual pets, entertainment robots, and ridiculous Star Trek episodes. This website is directly inspired by mimitchi- we miss you, Kat! Hope you're okay!</p>
				<p>My interests include, but are not limited to:<br><ul><li>Free and open source software, especially Linux and Linux-adjacents.</li><li>Electronics and radio technology. If you hear me on the air, please say hi!</li><li>Robotics, robots, and everything related. <br>I love robots of all kinds, spanning from robots intended for teleoperation in harsh <br> environments, to home robots, autonomy, and a focus on HCI.</li><li>NASA, ESA, JAXA, CSA, and Roscosmos, community science, satellites, space stations.</li><li>Advocacy, both locally and on the internet.</li><li><a href = "favorites.html">Media, especially when it involves computers, networks, and space travel.</a></li><li>Early 2000's design elements in the tech and video game sphere.</ul></p>
