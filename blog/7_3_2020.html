				<h1>7_3_2020 - launch</h1>
				<p>Last night was a little crazy. I couldn't sleep- but it wasn't the 'distracted and still tired' kind of awake. I was absolutely <i>energized</i>. So at 4:00AM, I threw together this website and I've been populating it with content today.</p>
				<p>I think the site looks okay so far, if not a little too sterile- I really want to make my website authentically me, but also interesting to look at. Eventually, I'll start making custom graphics- as the site continues to fill and new elements are added, hopefully it develops it's own charm!</p>
				<p>As it stands, this website is pretty Web 2.0 as far as neocities stuff goes, with flexboxes and (free, don't worry ganoo people) JavaScript making up some functionality, but I think modernity is okay if the website is quick to load and fun to use.</p>
				<p><img src="img/7_3_2020.jpg" style = "height: 200px;"><br>I'll update the website again tomorrow, going forward in big updates for now on so as not to clog up the neocities feed. We'll see how this goes.</p><br>
