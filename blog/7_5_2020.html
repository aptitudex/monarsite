				<h1>7_3_2020 - birthday party</h1>
				<p>As I've gotten older, I've noticed that getting older has a direct correlation to being less excited about holidays. It sucks- it's always nice to see people, especially now that we've been isolated so long, but something about the magic has worn away. Oh well. I got a couple of new books and a bit of money I'll be able to put into new projects to post about here, which I'm really happy about! Also, don't get confused- 7/3 isn't actually my birthday. Sorry, internet creeps, you'll have to try again another day.</p>
				<p>Someone followed this page on Neocities the other day! Hello, and welcome! I'm sorry that there isn't really anything here right now, but I'm always thinking about how I can fill out the web with interesting stuff, so please stay tuned! Thank you for being interested enough in this little corner of the WWW to press a button.</p>
				<p>I'll catch you all later.</p>
