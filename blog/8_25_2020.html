				<h1>8_25_2020 - lag</h1>
				<p>Well, it's been a while- that's for sure. I apologize for the lack of updates- as of today, I've been in quarantine for four or five months. I passed on Cross Country today because I was worried I had caught something, so here I am with some extra time to update the site. Finally!</p>
				<p>I've always loved putting my all into projects, and sadly I had some other things going on that took prescidence over this site, but I'm happy to say that I'm back now and have some solid content on the horizon.</p>
				<p>Thank you to all 5,000+ of you (!!!) that have visited my site! Talk to you again soon!</p><br>
