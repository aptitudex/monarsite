				<h2>What's a FIRST?</h2>
				<p>FIRST, put simply, is a non-profit organization that maintains and creates robotics competitions for young people all over the world. There are multiple levels of competition- LEGO League or FLL for elementary school, Tech Challenge or FTC as a 'junior varsity' and lower-budget middle and high school competition, and the Robotics Competition or FRC, the flagship program and self-described "varsity sport for the mind." I don't make this stuff up. FIRST programs may drip in cheesy one-liners and marketing slogans, but it's all part of the appeal.</p>
				
				<h2>My journey with FIRST</h2>
				<p>My experiences alongside FIRST have paralleled my growth as a person, so there's some of that in here.</p>
				<h3>elementary school</h3>
				<p><b>2012 - FLL "Senior Solutions"</b>
				<br>There weren't really "positions" on our FLL team as much as it was everyone scrambling to learn how to build a robot on the weekends! My Girl Scout troop recieved a grant for the FLL kit- it was a lucky break that was likely a catalyst for the rest of my involvement in robotics. FLL teams design a product or service that addresses a world problem aligning with the yearly theme. Our proposal? A walker with a sensor that yells at you to fix your posture.<br>We won the rookie award at our regional.<br><br>
				<b>2013 - FLL "Nature's Fury"</b>
				<br>Our project was an insulation to be added to a house in the event of an emergency to soak up water. The test product was created with a combination of coconut fiber and ShamWoW-equivalent towels. I distinctly remember creating a "simulation" for this in Minecraft with the sponge block. <br>We advanced to the state championships at Motorola this year. Back then, all the competition levels competed under one roof at certain competitions- seeing the bigger robots was insanely exciting.</p><br>
				
				<h3>high school</h3>
				<p><b>2017/2018 - FTC "Relic Recovery"</b>
				<br>Coming into high school, I pretty much begged my way onto the robotics team. Realistically, I had no chance- none of the teachers knew me <i>and</i> I was a freshman, but someone dropped out of one of our FTC teams last minute and they gave me a chance with the avalible slot. Our robot did terribly competitively- we were mostly rookies and the seniors were unengaged- but I finally started opening up to people in HS and it was a perfect training ground for the skills I would have to use and teach later.</p>
				<p><b>2018 - FRC "Power Up" - Electrician</b>
				<br>I found a home in FRC. Back then, the team culture was almost military- messing up would land you in deep trouble, or, worse, "off the team", but being able to cope well under pressure is a great skill to have. Regardless, this changed and I'm greatful for it.<br>For the first two or three weeks of the season, I was insanely anxious- I barely spoke to anyone at our meetings, despite my desperatley wanting to. It took solid encouragement from my mentor and some new friends to really break out of my shell, but over time, I was able to overcome most of the anxiety.<br>
				The team underwent a lot of unfortunate, harsh changes that year, but we all worked hard and alongside an amazing alliance, we won our state championship and went to worlds.</p>
				<p><b>2019 - FRC "Deep Space" - Head Electrician</b>
				<br>It was a year of change for the team! At the time it was overwhelming, but it all paid off and things are a lot stronger now. (We did lose FTC in the process.) My mentor was promoted to team captain, and suddenly there were dozens of people interested in being electricians after our victory- I went from working totally independently without a clue of how to mentor someone to being in charge of a big group of people that were my age or older. Thankfully, I had help, and I grew immensely as a person this year- my people skills improved slowly, as did my confidence.</p>
				<p><b>2020 - FRC "Infinite Recharge" - Head Electrician</b><br>
				The best robotics season any of us had, promptly cut in half by coronavirus. We were at the top of our game this year, being an alliance captain for the first time. Our robot was rock-solid, too! Sadly, we never got a chance to pull out all the stops, but we did walk away with a spirit award and some amazing competitive stats.</p>
				<p><b>2021 - FRC "Game Changers" - Team Captain</b><br>
				I am so insanely excited for this year!! My absolute best friends and I are finally seniors and it's our chance to give a new generation of freshmen the same experience we did. Obviously, I'll let you guys know how it goes.</p>
				
				<h2>Electrical Takeaways</h2>
				<p>It is possible to coast through setting up an FRC control system with very little electronics fundamentals under your belt. <b>However,</b> whether you're an aspiring FIRST student, a clueless teammate, a current FIRST electrician, or simply someone curious enough to look in, <b>I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to go beyond the bare minimum for FRC electronics.</b> National Instruments, WPI, CTR, REV, and FIRST have done a great job creating a hardware and software ecosystem that is incredibly beginner-friendly, but you will be able to troubleshoot more effectively, create more elegant solutions, and have more fun by digging deeper into your motor controllers' firmware and creating custom circuits.</p>
				<p>The control system is going to change after my graduation, but at least for now, as brushless motors become an even greater asset in FRC, the management of power and current draw on a robot has become a huge concern for many teams. The PDP is a sizable, but still limiting piece of hardware, and FRC's battery rules are strict. I have not used REV's ecosystem for brushless motors, but CTR does a good job at giving the user information back from the motors and I assume they do too.</p>
